Feel free to
[create an issue](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop-ctf/issues)
or
[post your ideas in the chat](https://gitter.im/bkimminich/juice-shop)!
Pull requests are also highly welcome - please follow the guidelines
below to make sure your PR can be merged and doesn't break anything.

## Git-Flow

This repository is maintained in a simplified
[Git-Flow](http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/why-arent-you-using-git-flow/)
fashion: All active development happens on the ```develop``` branch
while ```master``` is used to create tagged releases from.

### Pull Requests

Using Git-Flow means that PRs have the highest chance of getting
accepted and merged when you open them on the ```develop``` branch of
your fork. That allows for some post-merge changes by the team without
directly compromising the ```master``` branch, which is supposed to hold
always be in a release-ready state.

## JavaScript Standard Style Guide

The `npm test` script verifies code complicance with the `standard`
style before running the unit tests. If PRs deviate from this coding
style, they will now immediately fail their build and will not be merged
until compliant.

[![JavaScript Style Guide](https://cdn.rawgit.com/feross/standard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/feross/standard)

> In case your PR is failing from style guide issues try running
> `standard --fix` over your code - this will fix all syntax or code
> style issues automatically without breaking your code. You might need
> to `npm i -g standard` first.

## Testing

Pull Requests are verified to pass all of the following test stages
during the
[continuous integration build](https://travis-ci.org/bkimminich/juice-shop-ctf).
It is recommended that you run these tests on your local computer to
verify they pass before submitting a PR. New features should be
accompanied by an appropriate number of corresponding tests to verify
they behave as intended.

### Unit Tests

There is a full suite containing independent unit tests for each module.

```
npm test
```

### End-to-end Tests

The e2e tests simulate real input to the CLI and verify the printed
output to the console.

```
npm run e2e
```

### Mutation Tests

The [mutation tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing)
ensure the quality of the unit test suite by making small changes to the
code that should cause one or more tests to fail. If none does this
"mutated line" is not properly covered by meaningful assertions.

```
npm run stryker
```

> Only the unit tests are covered by mutation tests. For the end-to-end
> tests this would not be suitable for performance and concurrency
> reasons. The mutation tests are intentionally not executed on
> Travis-CI due to their significant execution time.
