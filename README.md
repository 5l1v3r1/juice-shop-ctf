> If you need help with the application setup please check the Troubleshooting section below or post your specific problem or question in the [official Gitter Chat](https://gitter.im/bkimminich/juice-shop).

- After changing to a different Node.js version it is a good idea to delete `npm_modules` and re-install all dependencies from scratch with `npm install`
