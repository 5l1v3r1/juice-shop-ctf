The [NPM package `juice-shop-ctf-cli` published from this repository](https://www.npmjs.com/package/juice-shop-ctf-cli) lets you create a list of `INSERT` statements for
the [CTFd](https://ctfd.io) database that will populate the platform for a [Capture the Flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag#Computer_security) event using
OWASP Juice Shop.

![Example of CLI usage](cli_usage_screenshot.png)

## Installation

```
npm i -g juice-shop-ctf-cli
```

## Usage

Open a command line and run:

```
juice-shop-ctf
```

Then simply follow the instructions of the command line tool. Finally, apply the generated `insert-ctfd-challenges.sql` following the steps described in the next section.

#### Setting up [CTFd](https://ctfd.io) and populating its database

1. Setup [Docker host and Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
2. Follow steps 2-4 from [the CTFd Docker setup](https://github.com/isislab/CTFd/wiki/Deployment#docker) to download the source code, create containers and start them.
3. After running `docker-compose up` from previous step, you should be able to browse to your CTFd instance UI (`<<docker host IP>>:8000` by default) and create an admin user and CTF name.
4. Once you have done this, run `docker-compose down` or use `Ctrl-C` to shut down CTFd. Note: Unlike a usual Docker container, data will persist even afterwards.
5. Add the following section to the `docker-compose.yml` file and then run `docker-compose up` again:

   ```
   ports:
     - "3306:3306"
   ```
6. You can then use your favourite MySQL client to connect to the CTFd database (default credentials are root with no password) and run the `INSERT` statement you created.
7. When that is done, browse back to your CTFd instance UI and check everything has worked correctly.
8. If everything has worked, do another `docker-compose down`, remove the ports section you added to `docker-compose.yml` and then do `docker-compose up` again and you are ready to go!

### Alternative approach without node.js

1. Download the
   [GenerateCTFdInserts.html](CTFd/GenerateCTFdInserts.html) file.
2. Open that file in your local browser and follow the instructions
   inside.

- If using Docker Toolbox on Windows make sure that you also enable port
  forwarding for all required ports from Host `127.0.0.1:XXXX` to
  `0.0.0.0:XXXX` for TCP in the `default` VM's network adapter in
  VirtualBox. For CTFd you need ports `8000` permanantly and `3306`
  during setup.
