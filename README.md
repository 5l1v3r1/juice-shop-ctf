The NPM package
[`juice-shop-ctf-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/juice-shop-ctf-cli)
lets you create a list of `INSERT` statements for the
[CTFd](https://ctfd.io) database that will populate the platform for a
[Capture the Flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag#Computer_security)
event using
[OWASP Juice Shop](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Juice_Shop_Project).

### Populating the [CTFd](https://ctfd.io) database

Apply the generated `insert-ctfd-challenges.sql` following the steps
describing your own CTFd setup.

#### Default setup (including SQLite database)

1. Get CTFd with `git clone https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd.git`.
2. Perform steps 1 and 3 from
   [the CTFd installation instructions](https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd#install).
3. Use your favourite SQLite client to connect to the CTFd database and
   execute the `INSERT` statements you created.
4. Browse to your CTFd instance UI (by default <http://127.0.0.1:4000>)
   and create an admin user and CTF name

#### `docker-compose` setup (including MySQL container)

1. Setup
   [Docker host and Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
2. Follow steps 2-4 from
   [the CTFd Docker setup](https://github.com/isislab/CTFd/wiki/Deployment#docker)
   to download the source code, create containers and start them.
3. After running `docker-compose up` from previous step, you should be
   able to browse to your CTFd instance UI (`<<docker host IP>>:8000` by
   default) and create an admin user and CTF name.
4. Once you have done this, run `docker-compose down` or use `Ctrl-C` to
   shut down CTFd. Note: Unlike a usual Docker container, data will
   persist even afterwards.
5. Add the following section to the `docker-compose.yml` file and then
   run `docker-compose up` again:

   ```
   ports:
     - "3306:3306"
   ```

6. Use your favourite MySQL client to connect to the CTFd database
   (default credentials are root with no password) and execute the
   `INSERT` statements you created.
7. Browse back to your CTFd instance UI and check everything has worked
   correctly.
8. If everything has worked, do another `docker-compose down`, remove
   the ports section you added to `docker-compose.yml` and then do
   `docker-compose up` again and you are ready to go!

- If using Docker Toolbox on Windows make sure that you also enable port
  forwarding for all required ports from Host `127.0.0.1:XXXX` to
  `0.0.0.0:XXXX` for TCP in the `default` VM's network adapter in
  VirtualBox. For CTFd you need ports `8000` permanantly and `3306`
  during setup.
